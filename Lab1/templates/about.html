        <h3>About Gustav:</h3>

        <p>Gustav is a crazy person living in Sk√§ggetorp. Sometimes he writes code. Sometimes the code looks elegant.
            Other times (most times) the code looks awful.</p>

        <p>This is a sample of Gustavs code:</p>

        <div class="codebox">
            <pre>{{ gustavs_code | escape }}</pre>
        </div>
        <p>As you can see, it looks awful.</p>
    </div>

        <p>As you can see, it looks awful.</p>
